üåü Overview
Database Sentinel is a specialized, low-overhead monitoring and performance analysis tool designed for mission-critical database environments at the OS and application layers. It's built to proactively identify and address performance bottlenecks in PostgreSQL and MySQL servers on their Debian Linux hosts.

This project demonstrates a mastery of a database SRE's core responsibilities: ensuring reliability, implementing observability, and leveraging automation to manage complex, distributed data platforms.

‚ú® Key Features
Hybrid Agent Architecture: Uses a lightweight Bash script for rapid, initial OS checks and a robust Python script for deep, database-specific analysis.

Full-Stack Observability: Monitors crucial Linux OS metrics (CPU context switches, disk I/O latency, swap usage) alongside detailed database metrics (replication lag, query performance, lock contention).

Automated Configuration Management: Uses SaltStack to automatically deploy agents, manage database clusters (with tools like Patroni), and apply optimal OS-level configurations like I/O schedulers and Huge Pages.

Query Performance Analysis: Automatically identifies slow-running queries, fetches their EXPLAIN ANALYZE plans, and recommends solutions for missing indexes or suboptimal join strategies.

Proactive Anomaly Detection: Monitors key metrics to predict and prevent outages, providing a unified view of the entire system.

‚öôÔ∏è Architecture
The system operates with a hybrid agent on each database host. The shell script performs fast, initial OS checks, and if the system is healthy, it calls a Python script for deep database and further OS analysis. The data is then exposed for a central Prometheus server to scrape. Salt is the control plane for deployment and configuration.

üöÄ Getting Started
To get started, clone the repository and set up a local testing environment.

Prerequisites
A Salt master and several minion servers.

A PostgreSQL or MySQL instance on the minion servers.

Python 3.x with database connector libraries (e.g., psycopg2).

Installation
Clone the Repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/database-sentinel.git
cd database-sentinel
Deploy with Salt: Use the provided Salt states to automatically deploy the agent to your database servers.
