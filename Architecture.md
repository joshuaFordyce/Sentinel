The architecture is a decentralized data collection, centralized configuration, and unified observability model.

Agent (Host):

Bash Script (db_check.sh): The entry point. A lightweight script for rapid OS health checks. It runs on a tight loop and, if all is well, it calls the Python script.

Python Script (db_analyzer.py): The "brain" of the agent. It performs detailed OS and database-specific checks and formats the data for collection.

Configurator (Salt Master):

The control plane for the entire database fleet. Salt is responsible for the initial deployment of the agent, ensuring the correct configuration (vm.swappiness, I/O scheduler), and providing a way to trigger automated remediation.

Observability Stack:

Prometheus: The data collector. It scrapes metrics from the Python agent on each host. It's a time-series database that is optimized for this kind of data.

Grafana: The visualization layer. It connects to Prometheus to provide a comprehensive, real-time dashboard of database and OS performance across the entire fleet.
